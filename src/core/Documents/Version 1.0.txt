jBomber v1.0 Design Document
==================================================================
The design document for v1.0 contains any information regarding the
creation, design, progress, and completion of this project.

This is a direct transcription of the document created on 6/17/10:
==================================================================
We want a 2D world (gameboard) with birds eye view and in the world
is a figure who is the bomber. The gameboard is a grid which will be
10x10 for now, but can be defined as X by Y in the future so that it
is variable (this will affect the way the GUI is designed though). 
Also in the world are obstacles which for now will only include boxes
and bombs. The bomber is able to walk up, down, left, and right if
there aren't obstacles in the way. As the bomber moves around, he is
able to drop bombs. After a prescribed amount of time, the bomb will
detonate. The bomb explosion will go in each of the four directions
a length of one grid space. Provided that one of the spaces isn't
a wall. The bomber starts each game with 1 life. If the bomber is hit
by his own explosion, then he loses a life. When a box gets hit by the
bomb explosion it is destroyed and disappears leaving an empty floor
space. For this version, the bomber will most likely start in the
lower left-hand corner for each game (however, this is specified in
the map text file, so it can be easily changed).
