Class Design for jBmomber:

Status:				Classes:		Fuctions:				Description:
					Game			main()					This will be the class that represents an instance of the game as an application. It
															will contain all the methods and variables that pertain to an instance of a particular game.
															
					GamePanel								This will be the class that runs the game and contains the threading. I am not sure what else
															this class is for, but I am pretty sure we need it.
					
					jBomber			main()					This will be the main portion of the game.
									pauseGame()				It will have the fuctionality to control the player, items, map parser, music, and graphics. (Networking if we get to it).
									resumeGame()			Could possibly create threads for all fuctions but not necessarily needed.
									stopGame()				
															
					Graphics		rePaint()				This class will be called anytime there is an update with a player or item in game.
									updateScore()			It will have control of all of our picture files and interact with them directly.
									updateCharacters()		Should really only be called when there is a need for a re-paint, otherwise waste of time.
									setMap()
									menus()
									
					Bomber			set/getScore()			The bomber will have a controller class inside to know its own controls.
									set/getHealth()			Will need to have a graphics class inside to call re-paint when bomber has moved.
									set/getName()			Can have variables for bomber name, score, life, etc.
									layBomb()				Will also need item class inside to lay bombs.
									
					Item			set/getPosition()		The item will need to know if it is a bomb or box to set fuse time if bomb.
									isBomb()				Will need to call graphics class to re-paint when bomb blows up or if box is blown up.
									isBox()					Bombs will need to be attached to a bomber to keep track of scoring points.
									fuseTime()				Need to create a thread for fuse time so know when to blow bombs up.
									addPoints()				Needs to check for other items in area to destroy.
									blowUp()
									
Should be done,		MapParser		parseMap()				This class will only be used at the beginning of a game to draw the original layout of a map.
though needs to						drawMap()				Will need to call graphics class to draw the original layout.
be tested.													Will need to return the map to the jBomber class so the bombers know where they are in the game.
															
					Position		set/getXCoord()			This class will be used by both bombers and items in the game.
									set/getYCoord()			It will keep track of everything's position in the world so it can be used for collision detection.
															Will also return x and y coordinates of everything to be use by collision class.
															
					Collision		checkCollision()		Will be used by bombs, items, and bombers in the game.
															Will be checked when a bomber moves or when a bomb explodes.
															Will need a list of the current map and where everything is.
															From this list, it can get x and y coordinates to check for collisions.
															If there is a collision, the game will re-paint itself.
															
Key press works,	Controller		keyReleased()			Will be used by only the bombers in the game.
need to figure out					keyTyped()				Will need to know if the bomber is Player1 or Player2 to determine controls.
how will integrate					keyPressed()			Will tell the bomber which way they have moved so the bomber can update its position.
to other classes.											Also defines special keys (escape, p, etc.) for special in-game purposes.
															jBomber will need a controller class to be used with a menu is up to select options.
